# Demo App SDK Usage Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to better align the demo app with SDK usage patterns and reduce code duplication.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. âœ… **Replaced Direct Contract Interactions with SDK Methods**

**Problem:** `lib/blockchain.ts` was duplicating SDK functionality with direct contract calls.

**Solution:**

- **SDK Enhancement**: Added universal `submitSignedGrant()` method
- **Demo App**: Now uses `vana.permissions.submitSignedGrant()` instead of custom contract code
- **Architecture**: Relayer service uses the same SDK method as client apps
- **Result**: No more duplicate permission logic between SDK and demo

**Files Changed:**

- `packages/vana-sdk/src/controllers/permissions.ts` - Added `submitSignedGrant()` and `createAndSign()` methods
- `src/app/api/relay/route.ts` - Uses SDK instead of custom blockchain code
- `src/lib/blockchain.ts` - Removed entirely (no longer needed)

### 2. âœ… **Centralized Storage Configuration**

**Problem:** `PinataStorage` was instantiated in 6 different files with duplicate configuration.

**Solution:**

- Created `src/lib/storage.ts` with centralized storage utilities
- `createStorageManager()` - Pre-configured storage manager
- `createPinataProvider()` - Server-side Pinata configuration
- `createClientPinataProvider()` - Client-side Pinata configuration

**Files Changed:**

- `src/lib/storage.ts` - New centralized storage configuration
- `src/app/api/ipfs/upload/route.ts` - Use centralized config
- `src/app/api/v1/parameters/route.ts` - Use centralized config
- `src/app/api/health/route.ts` - Use centralized config

### 3. âœ… **Removed Inefficient File Relay Endpoint**

**Problem:** `api/relay/addFile/route.ts` implemented an inefficient pattern where files were downloaded and re-uploaded.

**Solution:**

- Removed the entire `/api/relay/addFile` endpoint
- This endpoint was unused by the frontend and represented a bad pattern
- The SDK provides better direct file upload patterns

**Files Changed:**

- `src/app/api/relay/addFile/route.ts` - Removed entirely

### 4. âœ… **Removed Redundant Chain Configuration**

**Problem:** `lib/chains.ts` was just re-exporting chains from vana-sdk.

**Solution:**

- Removed `src/lib/chains.ts` entirely
- Import chains directly from `vana-sdk` where needed

**Files Changed:**

- `src/lib/chains.ts` - Removed (redundant file)
- `src/app/providers.tsx` - Import directly from vana-sdk

## Remaining Architecture

### Demo App Scope âœ… **Appropriate**

The demo app correctly demonstrates:

- Complete SDK usage patterns
- Real relayer service implementation (for demonstration)
- Storage provider integration
- Rich example application patterns

This is **appropriate scope** for a comprehensive demo app.

### Explorer Utils âœ… **Keep As-Is**

`lib/explorer.ts` provides utility functions for block explorer URLs. While viem has some support for this, having demo-specific utilities is reasonable for a rich example app.

### API Endpoints âœ… **Appropriate for Demo**

The API routes demonstrate:

- How to implement a relayer service
- Storage integration patterns
- Health monitoring
- Real-world usage patterns

This is valuable for developers building similar applications.

## Files Not Changed (Intentionally)

- `lib/explorer.ts` - Demo-specific utilities are appropriate
- `lib/relayer.ts` - Demo relayer functionality is appropriate
- API routes structure - Demonstrates real patterns developers need

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key Architectural Improvement: Simplified Permission API**

The most significant improvement was implementing a **universal permission submission pattern** in the SDK:

### **Before (Complex)**:

```typescript
// Multiple pathways depending on setup
if (relayerUrl) {
  await vana.permissions.grant(params); // Calls external relayer
} else {
  // Custom contract interaction code in demo app
  await submitPermissionGrant(typedData, signature);
}
```

### **After (Simplified)**:

```typescript
// One method works everywhere - client, server, relayer
const vana = new Vana({ walletClient }); // walletClient determines who pays gas
await vana.permissions.submitSignedGrant(typedData, signature);

// Or the full flow:
await vana.permissions.grant(params); // Works universally
```

### **New SDK Methods**:

- `createAndSign(params)` - Create typed data and get user signature
- `submitSignedGrant(typedData, signature)` - Submit already-signed permission (universal)
- `grant(params)` - Convenience method combining both (backward compatible)

## Summary

These focused improvements:

1. **Simplified architecture** - Universal permission submission method
2. **Reduced duplication** - Centralized storage configuration
3. **Better SDK usage** - Demo uses same SDK methods as any other app
4. **Cleaner separation** - No more duplicate permission logic
5. **Maintained demo value** - Still shows comprehensive patterns

The demo app now better demonstrates **how to use the SDK** rather than **how to work around it**.
