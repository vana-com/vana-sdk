# Demo App SDK Usage Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to better align the demo app with SDK usage patterns and reduce code duplication.

## Issues Addressed

### 1. ✅ **Removed Direct Contract Interactions**

**Problem:** `lib/blockchain.ts` was duplicating SDK functionality with direct contract calls.

**Solution:**

- Removed `submitPermissionGrant()` function that manually called contracts
- Demo should use `vana.permissions.grant()` instead
- Kept only relayer configuration for demo purposes

**Files Changed:**

- `src/lib/blockchain.ts` - Removed redundant contract interaction code

### 2. ✅ **Centralized Storage Configuration**

**Problem:** `PinataStorage` was instantiated in 6 different files with duplicate configuration.

**Solution:**

- Created `src/lib/storage.ts` with centralized storage utilities
- `createStorageManager()` - Pre-configured storage manager
- `createPinataProvider()` - Server-side Pinata configuration
- `createClientPinataProvider()` - Client-side Pinata configuration

**Files Changed:**

- `src/lib/storage.ts` - New centralized storage configuration
- `src/app/api/ipfs/upload/route.ts` - Use centralized config
- `src/app/api/v1/parameters/route.ts` - Use centralized config
- `src/app/api/health/route.ts` - Use centralized config

### 3. ✅ **Improved SDK Usage in API Routes**

**Problem:** `api/relay/addFile/route.ts` was using low-level contract calls instead of SDK.

**Solution:**

- Use `vana.data.uploadEncryptedFile()` instead of direct contract calls
- Let SDK handle transaction details and file ID extraction
- Simpler, more maintainable code

**Files Changed:**

- `src/app/api/relay/addFile/route.ts` - Use SDK instead of direct contract calls

### 4. ✅ **Removed Redundant Chain Configuration**

**Problem:** `lib/chains.ts` was just re-exporting chains from vana-sdk.

**Solution:**

- Removed `src/lib/chains.ts` entirely
- Import chains directly from `vana-sdk` where needed

**Files Changed:**

- `src/lib/chains.ts` - Removed (redundant file)
- `src/app/providers.tsx` - Import directly from vana-sdk

## Remaining Architecture

### Demo App Scope ✅ **Appropriate**

The demo app correctly demonstrates:

- Complete SDK usage patterns
- Real relayer service implementation (for demonstration)
- Storage provider integration
- Rich example application patterns

This is **appropriate scope** for a comprehensive demo app.

### Explorer Utils ✅ **Keep As-Is**

`lib/explorer.ts` provides utility functions for block explorer URLs. While viem has some support for this, having demo-specific utilities is reasonable for a rich example app.

### API Endpoints ✅ **Appropriate for Demo**

The API routes demonstrate:

- How to implement a relayer service
- Storage integration patterns
- Health monitoring
- Real-world usage patterns

This is valuable for developers building similar applications.

## Files Not Changed (Intentionally)

- `lib/explorer.ts` - Demo-specific utilities are appropriate
- `lib/relayer.ts` - Demo relayer functionality is appropriate
- API routes structure - Demonstrates real patterns developers need

## Summary

These focused improvements:

1. **Reduce duplication** - Centralized storage configuration
2. **Better SDK usage** - Use SDK methods instead of direct contract calls
3. **Cleaner imports** - Remove redundant re-exports
4. **Maintain demo value** - Keep appropriate demo-specific functionality

The demo app now better demonstrates **how to use the SDK** rather than **how to work around it**.
