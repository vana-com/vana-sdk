# Milestone 1: Core Components Validation

## Overview
This milestone validates that all core classes can be instantiated and basic functionality works correctly before building additional features.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETED (100% Pass Rate) - Import Paths Fixed

## Test Results
- **Date Completed**: Current
- **Pass Rate**: 5/5 tests (100%)
- **Duration**: ~2 seconds

## What This Milestone Tests

### 1. Configuration System ✅
- Configuration loading from environment variables
- Configuration validation with proper error handling
- Default configuration values
- Preset configurations (burst, conservative, debug)

### 2. API Server Infrastructure ✅  
- LoadTestApiServer instantiation
- Express server setup with CORS and JSON middleware
- Endpoint structure validation
- Mock operation management setup

### 3. Load Test Client ✅
- VanaLoadTestClient instantiation with test wallet
- Viem wallet client creation
- Vana SDK integration
- Wallet address generation

### 4. Data Portability Flow ✅
- DataPortabilityFlow class availability
- Import resolution and structure validation
- Ready for Vana SDK instance integration

### 5. Build System ✅
- TypeScript compilation success
- Module resolution working correctly
- All imports resolving properly

## How to Run Tests

### Quick Test
```bash
npx tsx milestones/ms-01/test-milestone1.ts
```

### API Server Test (Interactive)
```bash
npx tsx milestones/ms-01/test-api-server.ts
# Note: This starts a server on port 3003. Press Ctrl+C to stop.
```

## Expected Output

### Successful Run
```
🏁 Starting Milestone 1: Core Components Validation

📋 Test 1: Configuration System
  ✅ Configuration loaded successfully
  📊 Config preview: { totalUsers: 12500, maxConcurrentUsers: 1000, ... }
  ✅ Configuration validation works

🚀 Test 2: API Server
  ✅ LoadTestApiServer instantiated successfully
  ✅ API server ready for startup

👤 Test 3: Load Test Client
  ✅ VanaLoadTestClient instantiated successfully
  👛 Test wallet address: 0x2e988A386a799F506693793c6A5AF6B54dfAaBfB

🔄 Test 4: DataPortabilityFlow Structure
  ✅ DataPortabilityFlow class is available

🔧 Test 5: Build System
  ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
  ✅ All imports resolved correctly

📊 Milestone 1 Results:
  ✅ Passed: 5
  ❌ Failed: 0
  📈 Success Rate: 100%

🎉 Milestone 1 PASSED! Core components are working correctly.
🚀 Ready to proceed to Milestone 2: Single E2E Flow
```

## What's Validated

- ✅ **Type Safety**: All TypeScript types resolve correctly
- ✅ **SDK Integration**: Vana SDK imports and basic setup work
- ✅ **Configuration**: Environment variables and validation work
- ✅ **Server Setup**: Express server with proper middleware
- ✅ **Wallet Creation**: Test wallet generation and address derivation

## Next Steps

This milestone confirms the foundation is solid. The next milestone (MS-02) will test a complete end-to-end data portability flow with a single user.

## Dependencies Required

- Node.js 18+
- All packages from package.json installed
- TypeScript compilation working (`npm run build`)

## Troubleshooting

If tests fail, check:
1. `npm install` completed successfully
2. `npm run build` works without errors
3. Environment variables are properly formatted (see env.example)
4. No port conflicts (API server test uses port 3003)
