# Expert Response Results

Thank you for the detailed technical analysis and solutions! Your understanding of the async/await mechanics was very insightful, and we implemented your suggested approaches.

## Implementation Results

### ✅ What Worked

- **Tests Pass**: All your suggested test implementations pass without issues
- **Technical Approach**: Your `mockRejectedValue()` vs `mockImplementation(() => { throw })` distinction was educational
- **Code Quality**: The `vi.spyOn()` patterns you suggested are clean and proper

### ❌ What Didn't Work

- **Coverage Unchanged**: Despite passing tests, we're still at **99.53% branch coverage**
- **Same Uncovered Lines**: The exact same 3 branches remain uncovered:
  - `pinata.ts:216` - `error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Unknown error"`
  - `pinata.ts:257` - `error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Unknown error"`
  - `grantFiles.ts:135` - `error instanceof Error ? error.message : "Unknown error"`

## Specific Implementation

### Pinata Tests (Lines 216, 257)

```typescript
// Your suggested approach - tests PASS but branches not covered
it("should handle non-Error exceptions to cover the Unknown error branch (line 216)", async () => {
  const rejectionValue = "Network failure";
  mockFetch.mockRejectedValue(rejectionValue); // Non-Error string

  await expect(storage.list()).rejects.toThrow(
    "Pinata list error: Unknown error",
  );
});

it("should handle non-Error exceptions to cover the Unknown error branch (line 257)", async () => {
  const rejectionValue = { code: "INTERNAL_ERROR", reason: "Server exploded" };
  mockFetch.mockRejectedValue(rejectionValue); // Non-Error object

  await expect(storage.delete(testUrl)).rejects.toThrow(
    "Pinata delete error: Unknown error",
  );
});
```

**Result**: Tests pass ✅, Expected error messages match ✅, But coverage unchanged ❌

### Grant Files Test (Line 135)

```typescript
// Tried multiple approaches including your vi.spyOn suggestion
const startsWithSpy = vi
  .spyOn(String.prototype, "startsWith")
  .mockImplementationOnce(function (searchString: string) {
    if (this.toString() === grantUrl && searchString === "ipfs://") {
      throw errorMessage; // Non-Error string
    }
  });
```

**Result**: Tests pass ✅, But coverage unchanged ❌

## Coverage Analysis

When running coverage on just the pinata tests:

```
pinata.ts        |     100 |    97.22 |     100 |     100 | 216,257
```

This suggests:

1. ✅ Our tests ARE reaching the catch blocks
2. ✅ The `StorageError` with "Unknown error" IS being thrown
3. ❌ But somehow the `instanceof Error` check is still evaluating to `true`

## Questions for Expert

1. **Promise Rejection Behavior**: Could `mockRejectedValue()` be automatically wrapping non-Error values in Error objects before they reach our catch blocks?

2. **Vitest Mock Behavior**: Are there Vitest-specific behaviors that might be converting our non-Error rejections?

3. **V8 Coverage Interpretation**: Could V8 coverage be reporting branches differently than we expect?

4. **Debugging Approach**: How can we verify what type of object is actually reaching the catch blocks during our tests?

5. **Alternative Mock Strategy**: Are there other mocking approaches that might work better?

## Current Status

- **Starting Coverage**: 94.29%
- **Current Coverage**: 99.53%
- **Tests**: 554 passing, 0 failing
- **Progress**: Significant achievement, but stuck on final 0.47%

Your analysis was valuable and taught us important concepts about async error handling. We'd appreciate any additional insights on why the `mockRejectedValue` approach isn't hitting the false branch of the `instanceof Error` checks.
